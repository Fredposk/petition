# Petition Project


## About

The Petition project was the first full scale project merging the technologies we learned to make a fully funcioning website. Using a Node back-end, PostgreSQL database and handlebars templating engine. 

## Petition

The petition is about allowing free public transport, since that was the theme I added as a bonus a api to get the departures of the nearest station in the front page. The petition allows the user to log-in or create an account. They can leave their signature using a javascript function, afterwards they are free to view those who signed, those who signed at their choice of city, and their own account details. Which they are free to edit or delete entirely.

## Tech-Stack

Other than so much hands-on experience using node and express back-end, PostgreSQL as well as handlebars. We learned a lot about security, setting cookies and form validation (Csurf, Helmet, express-validator).
